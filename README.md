## Getting Started

When you launch Digimon NG, you'll begin your journey as a new Tamer:

1. **Choose Your Tamer Name**: Enter a nickname for yourself—this is how you'll be known in the digital world.
2. **Select Your Starting Team**: Pick from 6 different starter sets. Each includes:
   - 1 In-Training Digimon (beginner level).
   - 1 Rookie Digimon (basic fighter).
   - 1 Champion Digimon (stronger ally).
   
   These form your initial Battle Team, ready for action!

The main goal? Collect as many Digimon as possible! Expand your roster through battles, exploration, and data conversion. There's no "endgame" yet, so focus on growing your collection, leveling up, and dominating battles.

The game saves your progress automatically in some cases, but you can manually save anytime via the Action Bar or shortcuts.

## Main Navigation and Action Bar

The Action Bar at the top (or side, depending on your view) is your hub for everything:

- **Routes to Navigate**:
  - **Desktop**: Your home base for managing Digimon (Home and Farm areas).
  - **Adventure**: Where you explore locations and start battles.
  - **Lab (Digilab)**: View your collection and convert data into new Digimon.

- **Modals (Pop-ups) from Action Bar**:
  - **Digimon Storage**: Access your stored Digimon.
  - **Player Info**: Check your status (Bits, Level, EXP, Digimon count).
  - **Configurations**: Customize settings (more below).
  - **Save Game**: Manually save your progress.

You can switch between routes seamlessly, and modals overlay without leaving your current screen.

## Desktop Area: Home and Farm

This is your Digimon management hub, split into Home and Farm sections. Drag and drop Digimon cards between areas for easy organization!

- **Home**:
  - **Battle Team**: Place up to 4 Digimon here—these are your active fighters for battles in Adventure. Keep them healthy!
  - **Hospital**: Drag injured Digimon (low HP or 0 HP) here to heal over time. Perfect for recovery after tough fights.

- **Farm**:
  - **Training**: Assign Digimon to train periodically, boosting their stats like attack, defense, and speed. Great for powering up your team!
  - **Bit Farm**: Put Digimon to work generating Bits (the game's currency) every minute.

Pro Tip: Balance your assignments—don't leave your Battle Team empty!

## Adventure Area: Exploring and Battling

Head here for action! The **Explore** section lets you choose locations to battle wild Digimon.

- **Choosing Locations**: Unlocked based on your Battle Team's levels. For example, if your strongest Digimon is Level 30, you'll only see spots with a minimum level of 30 or lower. Each location has unique Digimon that can appear.
- **Starting a Battle**: Click a location to jump straight into combat (more on battles below).
- **Rewards**: Win fights to gain EXP for your Digimon and Player, plus Digi-Data percentages from defeated foes (used in the Lab).

Exploration is key to discovering new Digimon and grinding levels.

## Lab (Digilab): Collecting and Converting Digimon

This is your encyclopedia and recruitment center!

- **Digimon List**: See every Digimon you've encountered. Highlighted ones are those you've already obtained.
- **Converting Digi-Data**: Battles reward Digi-Data % for enemy Digimon. Reach 100% total for a species? Pay Bits to convert it into a new Digimon for your collection!
  - Button unlocks at 100%—click to add it to your roster (it goes to Storage initially).

Track your progress and expand your team here.

## Digimon Management: Storage, Details, and Evolution

- **Digimon Storage Modal**: Lists all unused Digimon. Drag them to Desktop areas or keep them safe. No limits mentioned, so hoard away!
- **Releasing Digimon**: Click the "X" in the top-right corner of a Digimon card (in Desktop or Storage) to discard it and free up space/data.
- **Digimon Details Modal**: Click a Digimon card (outside of battle) to view:
  - Name, Nickname (edit here to personalize!).
  - Stats: Rank, HP, MP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.
  - **Evolution Tree Button**: Opens a graph showing evolution paths for that digimon and base stats.
    - If your Digimon meets level requirements, an "Evolve" button appears.
    - Click to open a confirmation modal showing stat improvements.
    - Confirm "Yes" to evolve—your Digimon transforms with boosted power!

Evolution is a game-changer for tough battles.

## Player Progression: Bits, EXP, and Levels

- **Bits**: Currency earned from Bit Farm, battles, or other activities. Use for converting Digi-Data in the Lab.
- **EXP and Levels**: Gained from battles. Digimon level up individually (unlocking evolutions and locations). Your Player Level increases as well.
- **Player Info Modal**: Quick view of Tamer Name, Bits, Level, EXP, and total Digimon count.

Farm Bits wisely and battle often to progress!

## Battles: How to Fight and Win

Battles are turn-based and exciting, with animations for damage, highlights, and more.

- **Setup**: Your Battle Team (up to 4) vs. wild Digimon from the location.
- **Turn Order**: Based on Speed stats—faster acts first.
- **Actions**: Each turn, choose an enemy to attack. Enemies auto-attack.
- **Battle Log**: Tracks every move, damage, and status changes.
- **Win/Lose**: Defeat all enemies to win (gain EXP, Bits, Digi-Data). If your team wipes, retreat and heal in Hospital.
- **Visuals**: Shake effects for damage, fades for entries—makes fights dynamic!

Strategy: Match types (e.g., attributes like Virus, Data) and evolve for advantages.

## Configurations and Settings

Customize your experience via the Configurations modal:

- **Fullscreen**: Toggle full-screen mode.
- **Enable Audio**: Turn on/off sound effects and music.
- **Language**: Switch between English, Spanish, or Brazilian Portuguese.
- **Theme**: Choose from various color schemes for a fresh look.

## Controls and Shortcuts

- **Drag and Drop**: Move Digimon cards between areas.
- **Click**: Select locations, cards, or buttons.
- **ESC**: Close the topmost modal.
- **CTRL + S**: Quick-save your game.
- **ALT + F4**: Exit the game immediately.

## Tips and Strategies

- Start by building a balanced Battle Team: Mix levels and types.
- Use Farm areas passively—train for stats, farm for Bits.
- Grind low-level locations first to build Digi-Data and unlock conversions.
- Evolve early and often for stat boosts.
- Save frequently, especially before risky battles.
- Personalize with nicknames for that true Tamer feel!

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

- **How do I get more Digimon?** Battle to collect Digi-Data, then convert in Lab.
- **What if my Digimon dies?** HP 0? Hospital heals them—don't release unless you want to.
- **No sound?** Check Enable Audio in Configurations.
- **Stuck?** Save, reload, or use shortcuts to navigate.
- **Where's the mobile version?** There's no mobile version yet, but desktop is recommended for best experience.
